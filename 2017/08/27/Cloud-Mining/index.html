        <p>Buying a cloud mining contracts is a cheaper alternative than buying a mining machine. It has it advantages and disadvantages compare to buying a traditional mining machine. I will be explaining what is cloud mining and sharing my experience with “Genesis Mining”. I will be showing my payouts and other cluod mining services.<br><a id="more"></a></p>
<p>In the most simplest explanation cloud mining allow users users to buy mining capacity (hashes)  from data centers hardware. They will allow users to earn different coins(BTC, ETH, etc) without purchasing any hardware, software, bandwidth, electricity, and the typical large investment to get started in mining different coins. Due to removing all of the cost factors there are still external factors that it removes sounds the machine generates, the production of heat, the amount of space it takes and it allows people that do have the technical backgound or that are not comfortable building a computer to get started. So it can be quite beneficial to people who want to get started and not make a big investment, people that live in areas with high electricity cost and people who want to avoid the maintenance and upkeep trouble. Obvious, like everything in life it comes with its disadvantages. The first biggest one is fraud, you cannot really verify if the organization is shady or if it’s a ponzi scheme. Typically, from my experience when you are buying 1 or 2 year contract and you dont see return until the middle or late stages of mining contract. Sometimes you don’t get your payout right away, they make quite a bit of profit from hashing power and you are locked onto the hashing power you buy(Generally, but they do allow you to switch around different coins if you want). The last thing is that you can buy hashing power with Bitcoin but you can only buy a certain amount a day. So if you want to make a big purchase you cannot do it with using Bitcoin, you have to use a credit card (This is for Genesis mining). But if you use a Credit Card you have to wait 30 day until you get your first payout.</p>
<p>Generally, I had a positive experience with Genesis Mining. They were quick to answer different tickets I put. I typically get my payout on time, but as of now they have some bandwidth issues so I am getting payout every other day. The interface that they used is very clean and straightforward to use. They have a really nice reward system for each person that buy with your referral link. In benefits both parties, the person buying it gets 10 percent off and the the person with the referral link get a payout or more hashing power. Of course there are a few thing I don’t like, the first being once you buy your mining contract, you have to manually allocated. Which I think is really dumb, they should automatically allocated for you. The second thing I don’t like is that they don’t tell you that you have to wait 30 days for your first payout unless you read the contract. The last thing I do not really like is that when buying contract you can specifically specify how much hashing you want. You have to use there scroll wheel. </p>
<p>Bellow is my current payouts:<br><img src="/2017/08/27/Cloud-Mining/Payout.PNG" title="This is my current payout"></p>
<p>When determining services I was considering Genesis Mining or HashFlare. The difference between the two of them is that Genesis Mining has 2 year contract and lower hash rate and HashFlare is only 1 year and has higher hashrates. Originally, I was going to buy HashFlare but I ran into a problem where by accident I put x3 ETHASH of 28MH/S during that time it would have been 616 *3 = 1848. But the problem was that it did not updated and tell me I was purchasing three product. Luckily I was able to cancel the order on time and switch to Genesis Mining. The minute a company does that to me, I no longer trust it. I am sure that HashFlare fix this issue a long time, but I am happy with purchase. In the end you have to ask yourself do you want higher hash rate but lower contract terms or higher contract rate but lower hashrates. </p>
<p>In the end, I am happy with my purchase I beleive base my calculation I will be getting my money in around a year, which is not bad at all. I think that cloud mining has its benefits and its disadvantages. I think that its advantage overcomes its disadvantages. </p>
<p>If you do want to get started with Genesis Mining here is my Affliction code: GpjKDL<br>Or here a URL: <a href="https://www.genesis-mining.com/a/1005131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.genesis-mining.com/a/1005131</a></p>
