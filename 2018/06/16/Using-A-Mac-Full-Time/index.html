        <p>Five month ago I bought a 2017 Macbook Pro with the Touch Bar and have been using it for full time as daily computer. I will be talking about my opinion about the machine, what I like and dislike about it and some software that I used for my work environment.<br><a id="more"></a><br>To start off I come from a Windows background, but Windows was not able to perform up to par with what I needed it to do. There is also a lot of things that Windows does that made me move away from the OS. But that will be another post for another time.</p>
<p>When first getting the Mac, it frustrated me a lot as I was not familiar with the keybinds, or using the gestures on the trackpad. But over time I actually started enjoying using the trackpad. I also think the battery is very stellar and the screen is one of the most beautiful panel on a laptop that I have used.  What I really enjoy when using the Mac is the fact that it’s a unix based system but also at the same time with a very solid ecosystem where updates never really breaks user space. There a decent amount of customizability when you start looking at different software and program to replace the default Mac applications. This was a pretty nice experience as I was able to customize my terminal, my shell, I was able to replace spotlight. It was also a very nice experience allowing me to learn how docker works, writing bash scripts and learning more about unix.</p>
<p>A few things that I did not find very pleasant with the Mac, was certain issues such as Packages being broken for a very long time ie Htop, Python Python 3.6 certificate issues, Apple being a very hard company to deal with in general when it comes to open source software. Other issues that I dislike are the fact that sometimes I get graphical glitches which forces me to restart my PC, random red bar which you have to reset the NVRAM, Another thing I dislike about the Macbook is the keyboard not a very big fan of it and also the lack of IO ports. When trying to run a VM it’s typically very slow and unresponsive. When you have a USB C with ethernet connection and your mac goes to sleep you have to reconnect or unpredictable behaviours.</p>
<p>Overall, I as much as I enjoying using a Mac I think I will be switching a linux base system sometime in the near future. I think Linux base system will fit me much better and allow me to customizes as much as I want. I think the Macbook is to pricey for what it actually is, I bought one of the most expensive model as I wanted a 15 inch screen, 512gb of storage and 16gb of RAM. I think is very hard to justify the cost as you can build a powerful machine and run Linux with a nice Desktop environment(Maybe Deepin?) and it probably be just the same (ofc without the usual Apple flavour). But if you can justify the cost I think its a wonderful machine for many different people ranging from developer, video editor to just the casual users. I will still be using the Macbook but it will be my secondary computer for the meantime.</p>
<p>Application that I use:<br>Iterm2 - Terminal Replacement allows for more customizability<br>Alfred - A replacement of spotlight which allows allows for hotkeys, better searches and more customizable<br>Specticle - Allows for faster windows management<br>Dr Cleaner - Which allows me to have a fast indicator of ram usage and disk cleanup, etc</p>
