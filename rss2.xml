        &lt;p&gt;Five month ago I bought a 2017 Macbook Pro with the Touch Bar and have been using it for full time as daily computer. I will be talking about my opinion about the machine, what I like and dislike about it and some software that I used for my work environment.&lt;br&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Today, I have finished my last Co-op term at Manulife. In total I completed four Co-op terms(16 months). During these, four co-op I learnt a lot about the software industry such as communicating with customers, interacting with others and working in a team. I am going to be breaking down different companies I was working for, different contract I was doing on the side and my advice     for other co op students .&lt;br&gt;
